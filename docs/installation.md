# Installation

I recommend using [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit)
and [react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) from the official
redux team.

## NPM

```sh
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

## Yarn

```sh
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```
